 <p>Dear Robert Furzer,</p>


  <p><strong>Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Registration</strong></p>

    <p>Your RPA has now been registered by CASA</p>
    
    <p>A summary of your registered RPA as well as a downloadable copy of the Certificate of Registration is available in the <a href="#">myCASA</a> portal, under myCASA > Drones and RPA > Drone registration.</p>

<p>If your RPA does not have a serial number the Certificate of Registration will record the CASA assigned registration mark. This mark needs to be placed legibly on your RPA before it can be flown. You can fine more information on how to do this on the <a href="#">CASA website</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A person operating an RPA must hold the appropriate accreditation or Remote Pilot Licence.</p>
    
    <p>If your application relates to a foreign registered aircraft - the certificate is not, for that aircraft, a Certificate of Registration. Instead it is a permission to operate the aircraft in Austraion territory for the purposes of regulation 101.099 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998.</p>
    
    <p>Note: this permission is not a substitute for an accreditation, RPA Operator's Certificate or Remote Pilot Licence.</p>


  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>



  <p>Branch Manager<br />
